# 🎮 ImNotSure — An Indie Devlog of Procedural Survival and Pixel Dreams

Welcome to the development log of ImNotSure, a retro-style indie game blending pixel art aesthetics with procedurally generated survival mechanics. Born from a creative spark in May 2024, this project is a solo journey through code, design, and imagination.

👾 Created by TheDreamExMacchina, an independent Italian developer, this devlog chronicles the evolution of the game — from early concepts to playable prototypes, world-building experiments, and ambitious plans for multiplayer features and a public demo.

🛠️ Whether you're a fellow dev, a pixel art enthusiast, or just curious about the indie game-making process, this space is for sharing progress, ideas, and inspiration.
